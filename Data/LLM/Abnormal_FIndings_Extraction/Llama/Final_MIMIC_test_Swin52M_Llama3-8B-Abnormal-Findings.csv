1. Persistent right upper lobe opacity
2. Right basilar atelectasis
3. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle (may be due to a trace pleural effusion)

**Support and Monitoring Devices:**

None mentioned in the report."
p15182529,p15182529,heart size is normal . the aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications . the mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable . the lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted . streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis . no focal consolidation is present . there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . no acute osseous abnormalities are detected .,"Here are the abnormalities and support devices mentioned in the report:

**Abnormal Findings:**

1. Tortuous aorta
2. Atherosclerotic calcifications
3. Hyperinflated lungs
4. Emphysematous changes

**Support and Monitoring Devices:**

None mentioned in the report."
p13473781,p13473781,frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained . there is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis . there is also slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace pleural effusion . no definite consolidation is seen . there is no overt pulmonary edema . the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged . the aorta is calcified and tortuous . no definite pneumothorax is seen . degenerative changes are seen at the right shoulder .,"Here are the abnormalities and support devices mentioned in the report:

**Abnormal Findings:**

1. Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to a small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
2. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be due to a trace pleural effusion.
3. Enlarged cardiac silhouette.
4. Calcified and tortuous aorta.
5. Degenerative changes at the right shoulder.

**Abnormal Findings:**

1. Moderately enlarged heart
2. Mild pulmonary edema
3. Retrocardiac opacity likely due to atelectasis and effusion
